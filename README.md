## Use Case

Title - Bridging the Gap: The Impact of Inefficient Job Searches on Individuals and Recruiters

### Introduction

In today's competitive job market, both job seekers and recruiters face significant challenges. Job seekers often struggle to find suitable opportunities, while recruiters waste valuable time and resources searching for the right candidates.

### Challenges Faced by Job Seekers

All job seekers find themselves scrolling through job boards, submitting countless applications, and rarely hearing back from employers. Like millions of others, they experience frustration and uncertainty as they navigate the daunting job market.

### Challenges Faced by Recruiters

With numerous positions to fill and tight deadlines to meet, recruiters spend hours sifting through resumes, conducting interviews, and coordinating with hiring managers. Despite their efforts, they struggle to find the right candidates amidst the sea of applications.

### The Impact on Individuals and Businesses

According to data from the International Labour Organization (ILO), millions of individuals worldwide experience unemployment or underemployment, resulting in financial strain, emotional stress, and decreased job satisfaction. Similarly, inefficient recruiting practices take a toll on businesses, leading to prolonged vacancies, decreased productivity, and increased hiring costs.

### Size of the Recruitment Industry

The recruitment industry is vast and multifaceted, encompassing various sectors, including staffing agencies, online job platforms, and corporate HR departments. According to research from Statista, the global staffing industry generated approximately $497 billion in revenue in 2020, with continued growth projected in the coming years.

### Addressing the Challanges

Despite the scale of these challenges, there are opportunities for improvement.Automated resume screening, predictive analytics, and personalized job matching algorithms can help both job seekers and recruiters save time and resources while improving the quality of matches.

## Here comes our Solution

We are developing a Data Warehouse containing all resumes submitted by job seekers. Recruiters will have the ability to access potential candidates through various filters such as skills, job roles, location, and experience. Additionally, we will provide insights into our data pool, allowing recruiters to adjust their filters accordingly. Due to time constraints for the hackathon, we have developed a proof of concept using Angular JS, HTML, and CSS for the frontend, communicating with our Java Spring Boot backend. Our data is securely stored in PostgreSQL. We have many features planned, including pre-screening of job seeker data and ranking potential candidates to streamline the recruitment process.
